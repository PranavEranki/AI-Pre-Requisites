## Other notes:
[Differences](https://github.com/PranavEranki/AI-Pre-Requisites/blob/master/AI_ML_DL_Differences.md) between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, from my own understanding.

There are also some [notes](https://github.com/PranavEranki/AI-Pre-Requisites/blob/master/DifferentJobs.MD) on some different jobs in the AI field, and some differences among them.
