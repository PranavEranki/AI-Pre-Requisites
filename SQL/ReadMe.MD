# Some Basic SQL Notes

This folder contains some notes on SQL.

Here is a little command [cheat-sheet](http://www.zentut.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sqlcheatsheet.jpg) right here for reference. This cheat-sheet does not contain all the commands, but it is convenient.

Also, these notes does not contain much syntax for usage, as it is meant mainly to be a commands list/cheat-sheet, assuming you possess the syntax knowledge before-hand.
