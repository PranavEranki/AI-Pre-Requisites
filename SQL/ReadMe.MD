# Some Basic SQL Notes

This folder contains some notes on SQL. I used PostgreSQL for all my notes, projects, and more.

Here is a little command [cheat-sheet](http://www.zentut.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sqlcheatsheet.jpg) right here for reference. This cheat-sheet does not contain all the commands, but it is convenient.

Also, these notes does not contain much syntax for usage, as it is meant mainly to be a commands list/cheat-sheet, assuming you possess atleast some syntax knowledge before-hand.

Some covered topics:
* Operators
* General commands
* Where operators
* Joins, Unions
* Select statements
* Extract statements
* Operators and mathematical functions
* String functions
* Subqueries
* Data types
* Creating a table
* Editing a table (update, insert, etc.)
