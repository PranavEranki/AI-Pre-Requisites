# Why Data Visualization
* Easier to view data trends
* Easier to analyze data
* Easier to detect relationships between features


# Data Types

### Quantitative data:
* Discrete Data is countable data, whole numbers
* Continuous data is non-countable data (ex. income average), any number within a range

### Categorical Data
* Way of categorizing and labeling data into groups

### Ordered data
* Similar to categorical data, but the categories are ordered/ranked
  * Example - population bins
  * Example - class difficulty(hard,easy,etc)

### Time Series data
* Series of data collected via multiple measurements over time
* Has some implied ordering(i.e. data collection times )

# Visual Encoding
Position
* One value along x axis, another along y axis
* Different positions on graph mean different combinations of features
* Good for 2 dimensions

Retinal Variables
* Using size and other viewable features to make your different features on the visualization look different and distinguishable based on numerical data - example would be using different size and color of circles, instead of a point on a graph, to indicate some features.

# Best Visual Encodings
1. Position
2. Length
3. Angle and slope of lines
4. Area

# Exploring and explaining the data

## Preprocess Data
Extract the data from databases, csv files, etc.

Use tools like SQL or Web Scraping.

Then, clean the data - account for missing or unlabeled data, fix formatting, remove unnecessary features, etc.

## Exploring the data
You can use
* Bar Graphs
* Histograms
* Scatter Plots
* Other graph tools

To visualize your data

## Explaining the data
Look through your data - find trends, reasons for trends, and document them. Explain methods used to arrive to your conclusions.
