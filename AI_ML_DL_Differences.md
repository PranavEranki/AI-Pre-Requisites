# Artificial Intelligence

A branch of CS dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers.

A computer system's ability to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

Many ways of going about creating AI.

Can be a bunch of if statements, or a really complicated statistical model.


# Machine learning

A subset of Artificial Intelligence.

Able to modify itself and improve when exposed to more *(correctly labeled)* data.

Does not require human intervention to make changes to itself.

Tom Mitchell explains it well in his confusing but powerful quote - *A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E*


ML algorithms attempt to optimize along a certain dimension; i.e. they usually try to minimize error or maximize the likelihood of their predictions being true. This is often called minimizing the loss function, and is done through an extremely powerful method - __gradient descent__


# Deep learning

This is a subfield of ML which is concerned with algorithms based off the structure and function of the human brain, and are called artificial neural networks. The Neural networks in AI are infinitely less complex than the neurons and networks in our brain, but its a nice symbolism.
