- To avoid syntax errors when completing the assignments copy-paste the vectors, lines and planes in [OBJECTS_USED_IN_TESTS.md](https://github.com/PranavEranki/AI-Pre-Requisites/blob/master/LinearAlgebra/OBJECTS_USED_IN_TESTS.md) used in them.

- To follow the course explanation with my own notes go to [NOTES.md](https://github.com/PranavEranki/AI-Pre-Requisites/blob/master/LinearAlgebra/NOTES.md)
